# American Tidy Guy Mark Condor

Built with Next.js

Github-Actions setup to deploy to ec2 instance behind ELB.

AWS all setup for https://markcondor.com

Google Sheets as Data API for dev speed

Newrelic off and on for server monitoring

Curious to see what I can do in as short of a time as possible, given new life and other obligations.

Mark Condor is an Alt Persona : Think Marie Kondo but a dude who likes NASA, efficiency, and multimodal spaces.

Also, this is a space for me to experiment with new ideas and technologies.

trigger rebuild

Handy:
kill -9 $(pgrep -f '^next-server')
